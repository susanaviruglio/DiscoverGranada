## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project by Susana Viruglio
<img  src="/assets/images/presentation.jpg">

Discover Granada is a fictional tourist website that offers information about Granada, with an only purpose which is educational: places to visit, book activities, places to eat, what to do and information. The idea of the decoration project came to me while I was actually visiting Granada on my holidays, I thought it could be a great idea to bring my personal experience to life. As I was visiting this city I was collecting ideas for the project from every place I was visiting.
My principal goal is interested in attracting and retaining tourists so they can book activities.
Some potencial features to include are:

1. Photos ( views of places to go, places to visit,...).

2. Provide information on places to go with the proper addresses, opening hours, booking activities.

3. A map of Granada with information about how to get there, transport.

## UX AIMS

* To attract users between 25 and 45 years old who want to travel and get to know Granada, Spain.

### Home

#### Header

In my first page you will find the home page (header) where I described the purpose of this website with an introductory paragraph. I have added the principal header with a background picture. Beneath the principal image, I created the navigation menu with links of the three different web pages: what to do (information of places to go and what to eat) contact or about us (information about how to get there and a form if the user has any enquiry).

#### Section 1

Underneath I will have my first section(h2) Welcome to Granada! with a paragraph description of the website and introduction attracting the user to know more about it.

#### Section 2

In my section area I have provided the user with some interesting activities to book in Granada. I have used Bootstrap to create the layout and some pictures.

#### Footer

Finally I have created the footer where some link in social media and a copyright sign.

### What To Do

#### Header & Footer
I have decided to keep the same design for the header and the footer. So the main focus for the user is the content of the page.

#### Section 1

In my first section I have created a heading and a paragraph with an introduction to attract the reader and inform what they would find in the current page.

I have created to navigation links to make the user experience easier; I have divided into two parts: things to do and what to eat.

#### Section 2

In my following section I have divided into two groups as I said previously and I have link the headings with two ids. I organised the images and paragraph into an order list and every part has an image, so the user will find easy to read and to find information. 

Also, I have added some information links in some of the sections to make the experience better through out their online journey. I emphasized the information links with a *Font Awesome* icon so it is much easier to see for the user.


### What To Do

As my project should have at least three pages, I decided to add this final page with a simple user feedback or any simple enquire.

#### Section 1

It is a simple *Contact Us* heading and a paragraph with a simple sentence encouraging the user to ask a question or do a website feedback underneath.

#### Section 2

In this section I use HTML form structure with a textarea for the user to write a comment regarding the website, an email address to send the answer and a name, making sure that all the spaces are required and mark with a * so the users are already informed.

Next to this area I have placed a picture to make it visually more beautiful and attractive for the user experience.


#### Section 3

As this is my last section I wanted to create a FAQ section with the typical questions that a user could ask so they do not have to wait for an answer. I used summary to keep the text hidden for each question so the text does not occupied the entire site.

To inform the user about all the bus prices I created a table so it is clasified and easy to see. Underneath I added a picture of the map so the user can click on it and it will send them straight away to a new tab with an extended map.

Finally, I used iframe to link a google map with the location about the city center of Granada. Google search engine provides user with a link to use in Google Maps page, so I got the code from them.


## CODE ISSUES

### Bugs discover
* Navigation menu: I wanted my menu bar translucent with a bit of color, but when I was trying to do it with the Hex Value I could not change the opacity. So after trying and doing some researchs I tried to use RGB.

<img  src="/assets/images/website-navigationbar.jpg">
* I have had to change my navigation menu again because on my heading background and it did not work as I was expecting, so I move it underneath the header.
* I have used so much pixeles so it was very difficult to make sure the header was the same size in all devices.
* Section 1 general issue: once I created my navigation menu and the background for my header I wanted to create my first section ,but it did not appear beneath it. I checked my code and I found out that I had had set the background to position absolute, so I deleted and everything was working fine.
* Section 1 image issue: I had my own picture ,but it seemed to be broken everytime I doing the code. I found my mistake in my html area because I forgot the slash in front of the route link.
* What to do page: I had fix the measurement of the paragraphs and images because they were moving around and they had different size. I changed them for 500px width.
  

### Command issues 

#### First Issue
I have had two issues with my commands several times when I was trying to pull and push my work.
I was stuck with the commands I asked for help Code Institute Tutors Assistants. I followed these steps:
* git push origin HEAD:main
* git rebase --abort

My tutor informed that sometimes there are conflicts between your github repository and your local one. This can happen because I have made a change directly on github.  Here is how to do a git pull and fix and merge conflicts:
1.  git config pull.rebase false # merge
2.  git pull
3.  git status to see which files have a conflict that needs fixing
4.  then check those files and look for places marked with #### or <<<<. These are the areas that differ between your local files and the Github ones. Correct these areas until the code is how you need it to be. Save all the files you changed.
5. git add .  (don't forget the . that will add all the files changed since the last time they were committed.
6. git commit -m "fixed merge conflict"  You will know the merge is complete because (main | MERGING)  will return to just (main)  in the terminal
7. Finally git push origin main so all your files are synced up.

Then it worked and I could merge to my main branch. 
#### Second Issue
My second issue was very similar to my previous one ,but this time I could fix it by myself using the step above. I have realise that if I edite any file from my Github it will diverge the branch from the main.
## HTML AND CSS VALIDATOR 

<img  src="/assets/images/cssvalidator.jpg">
<img  src="/assets/images/htmlvalidator.jpg">
I have an ERROR that I have tried very hard to fix it. My mentor said that she would ask her team for more information. The rest was everything fine.

## DEPLOYMENT

I have created my project on *GitHub* and I have developed it in *Codeanywhere*.

Once I have finished my project I saved all my files, then I pulled and pushed to *GitHub*

1. First, I have typed this command "git remote -v",this command shows the git repo is connected to the GitHub repo.
2. Secondly, I typed git status and git push.
3. Then I went to *GitHub* and I refreshed the page. So I saw that all the codes where visible.
4. I clicked the *Settings* of my project.
5. Then I went to *Pages* and under "Build and Deployment", I found the source which I select Deployment from a branch.
6. Finally I was allowed to share my live website with others.

Here is the following link to see my project. [Discover Granada]()
## CREDITS


### CODE

All the code that I have used to create this website was taken from Code Institute learning platform a part from the next following sources:

[BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  
- I used *Bootstrap 4.0* version, mainly I used the gryd system to build layouts.

- Button for my *Plan Your Trip* section in my home page, I use this button instead of the Code Institute one because I found easier to style the color and font. 

[GOOGLE Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/xt4XQxu72ZrKfuA56)

- I used an iframe provided from Google maps sections. I searched for Granada address and I copied the HTML code.
  

[W3SCHOOL](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  
- How to insert an image in my HTML file. Code example provided: *(img src="pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli")*.

- The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. I learned that using RGBA you can change the opacity of the color. Example provided: *(background: RGBA(207, 132, 14, 0.5))*.

- CSS border-block-end-width Property. I wanted to give a little touch to my menu bar so the user could see a blue line separating the header from the rest of the page. Example provided:*(border-block-end: 5px solid #25336B)*.

[LINUXHINT](https://linuxhint.com/set-font-border-css/)
  
- With CSS, you can style fonts in several ways. For instance, we can set the border for a font to make it more attractive with respect to its looks. A font border is also added when it is required to outline some text. It also permits you to style the text and add color and width according to your preferences. Code example provided: *(webkit-text-stroke: 1px #CF840E)*.
