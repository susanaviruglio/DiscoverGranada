                        <summary>How to get in Granada?</summary>
                        <p> Granada has good air and ground connections that provide easy access to the city by various
                            means of transport: plane,
                            bus, train, car and taxi. Granada Airport is 20 km from Granada and has very good
                            communications with the capital.
                        <h5>Getting from Granada Airport</h5>
                        <p>You can also get to Granada by taxi. A taxi from Granada Airport to the city centre costs
                            around 30 euros.
                            Visitors can reach Granada city centre in a special airport bus service. This bus runs
                            through the centre of Granada and
                            terminates at the Exhibition and Conference Centre.
                            <br>
                            It is better to ask how much it will cost before getting into the taxi, because the taxi
                            drivers sometimes charge you a
                            higher price, especially if you're from abroad.
                        </p>
