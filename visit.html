                                            in
                                            Spain, and obviously, the best place to see in Granada.
                                            <br>
                                            The monumental combination of the Alhambra, where the Nasrid kings and the
                                            entire court who lived there between 12th and 15th centuries, is made up of
                                            the <em>Alcazaba</em>, the <em>Palaces</em>, the <em>Generalife</em> gardens
                                            and infinity of patios,
                                            fountains and impressive displays of Moorish art.
                                            <br>
                                            Also in its golden age its interior hid mosques, workshops, schools,gardens,
                                            fountains, love, heartbreak, houses, kittens, business, fun and suffering.
                                            Centuries have passed since the reconquest ended Arab hegemon and not even
                                            Napoleon was able to end it; it seems that Spanish solider did not want obey
                                            his order to demolish it with explosives. Goodness! Without a doubt, it is
                                            the great jewel to see in Granada.

                                            The <em>Albaicin</em> is the old arab quarter of Granada with its steep,
                                            cobbled streets and white houses dotted with the colours of bougainvillea,
                                            it is the beating heart of the city. Go through it, even if it is only to
                                            reach the <em>San Nicol√°s</em> viewpoint, from where you can enjoy the best
                                            views of the Alhambra, accompanied by the fragance of jasmine and the
                                            melodies of streen musicians.
                                            <br>
                                            However, we have to worn you, it is easier to finish Rubik's Cube in 3
                                            minutes than walk through the Albaicin without getting lost. Although it is
                                            one of the charms of it, so do not worry sometimes losing your way is
                                            essential. So now you know that going up, wandering around and getting lost
                                            in the Albaicin is one of the best things to do in Granada. Do you agree?

                                            <em>The Darro River</em> is a tributary of the Genil that flows through
                                            Granada and crosses the center of the city between the
                                            Albaicin hill and the hill of the Alhambra. Of the thirteen bridges that
                                            used to pass through Granada, the Darro has
                                            maintained only four. Two of them are located on the famous Carrera del
                                            Darro, the Cabrera and Espinosa, and are made of
                                            brick and stonework.

                                            <em>Jardines de Zoraya</em> is an old carmen renovated to house the
                                            restaurant and
                                            tablao where flamenco and gastronomy merge,
                                            offering an unforgettable experience to the palate and the rest of the
                                            senses.

                                            They have an indoor lounge and an Andalusian patio-style terrace, suitably
                                            air-conditioned depending on the time of year.

                                            Their artists offer a close and intimate show. Enjoy a painting that
                                            expresses passion, strength and energy in abundance.
                                            In just one hour, you will be able to observe the singing, dancing and
                                            guitar playing of pure Andalusian art. These
                                            artists have the technique, the experience and, above all, the "duende" that
                                            is needed to succeed in this art. These
                                            feelings go beyond the tablao, everyone enjoys the show: children, adults,
                                            nationals, foreigners... This art knows no
                                            borders.

                                            The Catedral de Granada sits in the center and is one of the most beautiful
                                            buildings in the city. Like many of the
                                            cathedrals in Spain, it was built on top of a mosque after the period of
                                            ‚ÄòReconquista‚Äô (when the Christians took back
                                            Spain from the Moors).
                                            <br>
                                            These days, you can see the renaissance architectural style. This gives the
                                            Catedral de Granada an Italian feel,
                                            especially with the beautiful marbled square in front.
                                            <br>
                                            To escape the heat, visit the beautiful interior with its gold leafing,
                                            stained glass, and impressive stone arches and
                                            columns. On your way out, look for the artists painting in the outside
                                            square.

                                            in 1997 and said it has "the most beautiful sunset in the world", the

                                            If there is one aspect of Spanish cuisine that is best known around the
                                            world, it is the custom of eating tapas. Today,
                                            this culinary tradition is replicated in bars and restaurants across the
                                            globe.
                                            <br>
                                            In some places in Spain, most famously in Granada, tapas
                                            are served for free in bars when customers
                                            order a drink. The theory is that by serving salty snacks the owners are
                                            likely to encourage the customers to drink more
                                            to quench the thirst provoked by the food. This custom of complimentary
                                            tapas is not universal across Spain and in
                                            regions where it is not the case, tapas can be ordered from a menu (and paid
                                            for) like any other dish. In some cases it
                                            is also possible to order a larger portion of the same dish, in this case
                                            referred to as a raci√≥n, which is usually more
                                            economical for larger groups.
                                            <br>
                                            You will find lot of bares or places to have some tapas. Just walk around
                                            the city and you will hear the loud noise of people drinking!

                                            You can not leave Granada without trying the most popular sweet,
                                            <em>Pionono</em>. This small cake is a delight to anyone who tastes it,
                                            quite
                                            hard to forget. We can identify two parts in this little
                                            cake. A very thin layer of moistened pastry rolled up into a cylinder,
                                            filled
                                            with a special cream and cinnamon. The
                                            other one is the toasted cream on top. You will find it in any bakery around
                                            the
                                            city center, but you could try it in <em>Madre de Cris</em> which is located
                                            in
                                            "Plaza Pescader√≠a, 1" very close to the Cathedral.
