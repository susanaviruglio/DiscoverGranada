                                            <em>The Alhambra</em> is a World Herigate Site and the most visited monument
                                            in
                                            Spain, and obviously, the best place to see in Granada.
                                            <br>
                                            The monumental combination of the Alhambra, where the Nasrid kings and the
                                            entire court who lived there between 12th and 15th centuries, is made up of
                                            the <em>Alcazaba</em>, the <em>Palaces</em>, the <em>Generalife</em> gardens
                                            and infinity of patios,
                                            fountains and impressive displays of Moorish art.
                                            <br>
                                            Also in its golden age its interior hid mosques, workshops, schools,gardens,
                                            fountains, love, heartbreak, houses, kittens, business, fun and suffering.
                                            Centuries have passed since the reconquest ended Arab hegemon and not even
                                            Napoleon was able to end it; it seems that Spanish solider did not want obey
                                            his order to demolish it with explosives. Goodness! Without a doubt, it is
                                            the great jewel to see in Granada.

                                            The <em>Albaicin</em> is the old arab quarter of Granada with its steep,
                                            cobbled streets and white houses dotted with the colours of bougainvillea,
                                            it is the beating heart of the city. Go through it, even if it is only to
                                            reach the <em>San Nicol√°s</em> viewpoint, from where you can enjoy the best
                                            views of the Alhambra, accompanied by the fragance of jasmine and the
                                            melodies of streen musicians.
                                            <br>
                                            However, we have to worn you, it is easier to finish Rubik's Cube in 3
                                            minutes than walk through the Albaicin without getting lost. Although it is
                                            one of the charms of it, so do not worry sometimes losing your way is
                                            essential. So now you know that going up, wandering around and getting lost
                                            in the Albaicin is one of the best things to do in Granada. Do you agree?

                                            <em>The Darro River</em> is a tributary of the Genil that flows through
                                            Granada and crosses the center of the city between the
                                            Albaicin hill and the hill of the Alhambra. Of the thirteen bridges that
                                            used to pass through Granada, the Darro has
                                            maintained only four. Two of them are located on the famous Carrera del
                                            Darro, the Cabrera and Espinosa, and are made of
                                            brick and stonework.

                                            The <em>Albaicin</em> is the old arab quarter of Granada with its steep,
                                            cobbled streets and white houses dotted with the colours of bougainvillea,
                                            it is the beating heart of the city. Go through it, even if it is only to
                                            reach the <em>San Nicol√°s</em> viewpoint, from where you can enjoy the best
                                            views of the Alhambra, accompanied by the fragance of jasmine and the
                                            melodies of streen musicians.

                                            However, we have to worn you, it is easier to finish Rubik's Cube in 3
                                            minutes than walk through the Albaicin without getting lost. Although it is
                                            one of the charms of it, so do not worry sometimes losing your way is
                                            essential. So now you know that going up, wandering around and getting lost
                                            in the Albaicin is one of the best things to do in Granada. Do you agree?
